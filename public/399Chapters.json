And I couldn't even imagine, But I actually think the bigger pain for him, because my father is such a committed person to the family, is like, did I let my family down? Did I let my kids down? And I do think he felt at that moment like his life was over. He couldn't really see past what this challenge was gonna bring and if There would be a life for him after it. So I I could see that he had a lot of fear, and he really wasn't saying much. And then I didn't know what to do. And so I just Stood by him and stood close. And, You know, later that that that day or the next day, he got up and started walking. He had an ankle monitor. For whatever reason, the prosecutor was such a so aggressive. He was a flight risk, so they made him wear an ankle monitor. They were very, very aggressive been nasty. And at the time, my father was the biggest, donor to Democrats. The prosecutor was a Republican. It was a very political thing. And, What happened was is is, he was walking around the pool, and I just started walking with him.

God's the dealer, and we have to, you know, come down to earth to understand, like you said.

      "chapter_summary": "You know, we can go through long explanations for that. But if there truly is a real forum and station of information, then you would think that the marketplace of ideas would surface the real ones and discredit the nonreal ones. And I think that as a society, we're starting to kinda come to Gri with the fact that the power dynamic is changing and that some of these institutions that we used to have a lot of faith in Don't deserve our faith, and some of them, you know, will actually reform and maybe re earn our faith. So I think that there could be an optimistic tone. Again, the years of Trump, I think that, You know, he was an outsider, and, you know, he represented something that was existential for this to the system. Right? You think about for The 30 years before, you were either part of, you know, the Clinton dynasty or the Bush dynasty. I think a lot of people in the country felt like That whole class, whether you're wearing a red shirt or a blue shirt wasn't representing them, and Trump represented a true outsider to that system. And I do think that as he went in there, there was a lot of norms that were broken to try to stop him from changing the traditional power structure. So I think that we're at a time where maybe there will be an optimistic breakthrough where you'll have institutions that will allow for A lot more transparency into what truth really is. I'd love to go back and talk to you about the Middle East because there's so many interesting components to this. Let's talk about Saudi Arabia. And first, let me ask you about MBS, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince. So you've gone to know him pretty well. You've become friends with him. What's he like as a human being? Just on a basic human level. What's he like?\nassistant: So for the listeners, Mohammed bin Salman is now the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. He has risen to that position over the last couple of years and he's been a tremendous reformer for the country. He's gone in and he's really modernized the economy. He's put a lot more investment into the country. He's marginalized the religious police, and he's really done a good job to bring modernization and reform. So he's been a great reformer. What he's like as a person is he's a very high energy. He's got tremendous intellectual capacity. Very well-read when he was younger. His father would give him a book a week and make him report on it on the weekend. He was very focused on learning, and that's something that I found, you know, quite impressive about him. I think in some ways, he reminds me a lot of young President Trump. They both have this kind of outsider mentality. They're both very focused on achieving their goals, and they don't take no for an answer. They're not afraid to go against the status quo. And so it was interesting to see them in a conversation together because they have that similar personality dynamic, which I think helps build a lot of chemistry between the two countries. So he's got this tremendous energy, intellect and a real focus on achievement. That's what I would say about him as a person."

      "chapter_title": " Navigating Tensions and Achieving Peace in the Middle East\nYeah. So what he said to me was was no different than what he ultimately said on 60 Minutes, which was, You know, as as as somebody helping lead this country, I bear responsibility. And, and I'm gonna make sure that those who are involved are brought to justice, And I'm gonna make sure that, that we put in place reforms to make sure things like this don't happen again. It was a horrible situation, that occurred. What I saw from him after that was just a a doubling and a tripling down on on the positive things he was doing, figuring out ways to kinda continue to modernize society, build opportunity in in in the kingdom and to continue to be a better ally to all the different countries that wanted to be, aligned with them. One thing I learned from this case is how one particular situation, a tragedy, can destroy so much progress and the possibility of progress and and the possibility of connection between the bridges that are built between different nations. Mhmm. And how narratives around that can take off and take such a long time to repair. And you've worked with this in the Middle East with Israel and so on how the history, the the narratives, the stories, They they kinda have this momentum that's so hard to break even when you have new leaders, new blood, new ideas that come in. And it's it's just sad to see that, yes, this, tragedy happens, but it doesn't mean that you can't make progress. I don't know if you have kinda lessons from that. Just how much of a dramatic impact it had on creating tension between the United States and Saudi and in general in the Middle East, like the, that somehow saw it. He's not a friend, but is against the ideals and the values of the United States. Yeah. So it it definitely created massive tension and it became a very high profile, action that actually overshadowed a lot of the good work That was being done in the region and a lot of the progress we were making. But when you think about this or you think about the other issues that we've gone through today, I think the general framework that I always try to approach things with is you can't change what happened yesterday. You can only learn from it, and then you can change how you deal with tomorrow. And when I think about, you know, the people in power, What do I hope that they're spending their time focused on? Number 2 basic things. Number 1 is, how do I create, you know, safety and security for for my people, and and for the world. And then how do I give people the opportunity to live a better life? And so when things like this happen, obviously, You know, there are certain reactions that are appropriate, but ultimately, you have to think through how do you not allow the paradigm that you're creating in the world To lead to worse outcomes than would happen otherwise. And so when I would think about foreign policy in general, one of the differences between foreign policy And business is that in business, if you make a mistake, you can usually fix it relatively quickly, but in foreign policy, because of the global implications, sometimes those decisions can have long term consequences. So, as we always say in the world of international relations, once you start down the slippery slope, it's very hard to get back up again.
