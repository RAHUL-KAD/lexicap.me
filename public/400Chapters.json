In fact, I think my feeling is that one should be never trust a cynic. The reason is that Cynics excuse their own bad behavior by saying everyone does it because they're cynical. So I always be it's a red flag if someone is a cynic, a true cynic. Yeah. There's a degree of projection there that's always fun to watch from the outside and enjoy the Well, it's just hypocrisy. If but even, like, this is an important point that I think people who are listening should bear in mind. If If somebody is cynical, meaning that they see bad behavior in everyone, it's easy for them to excuse their own bad behavior By saying that, well, everyone does it. It's not true.

Not in a stupid, shallow, naive way, but, like, in an awesome, like, oh, something awesome happened and you celebrate them for it. It's It feels that that is outweighed by shitting on other people. Now it's better than mainstream media, but it's still Yeah. Mainstream media is Almost relatively negative about everything. I mean, really, the conventional news tries to answer the question, what is the worst thing that'll happen on Earth today? Mhmm. And it's a big world. So on any given day, something bad has happened. And a generalization of that, what is the worst perspective I can take on a thing that happened? So Yeah. It's I don't know if there's just a strong negative bias in the news. I I mean, I think that's what the what a possible explanation for this is evolutionary, where, You know, bad news historically would be potentially fatal. Like, there's lion over there or there's some other tribe that wants to kill you. Good news, You know, like, we found a a patch of berries. It's nice to have, but not essential. So our old friend, Tesla autopilot, and it's probably one of the most intelligent real world AI systems in the world. Right. You followed it from the beginning. Yeah. It was one of the most incredible robots in the world and continues to be. Yeah. And it was really exciting. And it was super exciting when it generalized, became more than a robot on 4 wheels, but, a real world AI system that perceives the world. Yeah. And has can have potentially different embodiments. Well, the really wild thing about the Anton training is Like, it learns to read like, you can read science, but we never taught it to read. So, Yeah. We never taught it what we never taught it what a car was or what a person was or a vice cyclist. It learned what all those things are, what all the objects are on their own, from video, Just from watching video, just like humans. I mean, humans are photons and control controls out. Like, the vast majority of information reaching our brain is from our eyes. And you say, well, what's the output?
